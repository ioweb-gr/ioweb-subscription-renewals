### IOWEB SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL

A small extension to present us with an overview of subscriptions' expiration dates.

#### Features

- Colors depending on status
 
```  
 Red    -> Expired
 
 Orange -> Expires in less than 14 days
 
 Green  -> More than 14 days remaining 
 ```
   
- Sorted by days remaining (oldest shows first)
- Easy access through a menu item (Expirations Overview)


#### TODO

- [Definitely] Add link to subscription
- [Definitely] Add sorting and filters
- [Definitely] Add pagination
- [Possibly] Add filter for days (e.g. between 5 and 100 days remaining)
- [Possibly] Multilingual
